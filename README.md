# jupyter-exploration

This repository was created as part of a lab assignment to introduce the basics of GitHub and Jupyter Notebooks.

In this lab, I learned how to:
- Create and manage a GitHub repository
- Make commits and push changes using GitHub
- Access and use Jupyter Notebooks
- Create and run Markdown and Python code cells

The repository includes my first Jupyter Notebook, which contains a simple Markdown cell and a Python code cell demonstrating basic notebook functionality.
